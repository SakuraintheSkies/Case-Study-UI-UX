## 🔧 Design Process

### 🧩 Frame-Based Design
- Multiple screens created as **individual frames** (Home, Playlist, Now Playing, etc.)
- Connected using **interactive links and transitions**
- Used **smart animations** for a realistic feel (e.g., button presses, music bar)

### ✍️ Visual Style
- Soft, **romantic colors** and glow effects
- Friendly rounded icons and typography
- Floating music waves and profile-based greeting

### 🔁 Prototyping in Figma
- Linked all frames via **prototype mode**
- Simulated **user journeys** (opening app → playing a song)
- Applied **animated interactions** between screens
